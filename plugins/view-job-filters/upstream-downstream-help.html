<div>
    This filter includes jobs based on their upstream/downstream relationships.
</div>

<h4><u>Rationale</u></h4>

<p>
    Useful to group together jobs that are connected via the
    "Build after other projects are built" and "Build other projects"
    configurations.
</p>

<h4><u>Options</u></h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Include downstream jobs:</dt>
    <dd>Match any jobs that depend on an already matched job.</dd>
    <dt>Include upstream jobs:</dt>
    <dd>Match any jobs that are depended on by an already matched job.</dd>
    <dt>Include upstream/downstream jobs recursively:</dt>
    <dd>Also include jobs connected via transitive dependency relations</dd>
    <dt>Do not show source jobs:</dt>
    <dd>Only show upstream/downstream jobs, not the original jobs this filter is being fed.</dd>
</dl>


<h4><u>Note</u></h4>

<p>
    This filter doesn't add any jobs itself, it builds off of the jobs included by previous filters. This means
    that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>This filter will not include any jobs if there are no jobs already selected.</li>
    <li>This filter (like most other filters) is capable of removing jobs that were already selected.</li>
</ul>
