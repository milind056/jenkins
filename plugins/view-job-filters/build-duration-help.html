<div>
    This filter includes/excludes jobs based on their build durations.
</div>

<h4><u>Rationale</u></h4>

<p>
    Useful if you have jobs that should be running quickly and you want to easily
    find them when they take longer. The opposite might also make sense: if you know
    that a job should take a long time, but finishes too fast this might be an
    indication that something is wrong with that job.
</p>

<h4><u>Options</u></h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Build duration:</dt>
    <dd>How long a job's builds need to have taken in order for this filter to match.</dd>
    <dt>How far back to check:</dt>
    <dd>
        A job can have many builds and this option determines how many of those builds
        will be checked. Always goes backwards from the latest build. Can be a decimal
        number, e.g. <kbd>1.5</kbd> hours. If you want to include all builds set this
        value to <kbd>0</kbd>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Match type:</dt>
    <dd>
        Whether to add or remove jobs from this view. There's two kinds of match types:<br>
        <ul style="margin-top:0px">
            <li>Include matched/unmatched: adds additional jobs to this view.</li>
            <li>Exclude matched/unmatched: removes jobs from this view that have been included by previous filters.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4><u>Examples</u></h4>

<ul>
    <li>Show all jobs where the last build took longer that an hour.</li>
    <li>Show all jobs where at least one build took longer than 10 hours.</li>
    <li>Show all jobs where every build in the last week took less than a minute.</li>
</ul>
