<div>
    This filter includes/excludes jobs that haven't already been included in another view.
</div>

<h4><u>Rationale</u></h4>

<p>
Useful if you have hundreds of jobs organized into views, and you want an easy way to identify
which jobs haven't been "classified" into a view yet.
</p>

<h4><u>Options</u></h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Match type:</dt>
    <dd>
        Whether to add or remove jobs from this view. There's two kinds of match types:<br>
        <ul style="margin-top:0px">
            <li>Include matched/unmatched: adds additional jobs to this view.</li>
            <li>Exclude matched/unmatched: removes jobs from this view that have been included by previous filters.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4><u>Note</u></h4>

<p>
Because this filter looks at other views, there is a risk of creating circular references between views
which can lead to unpredictable behavior. This filter will warn you if that's the case.
