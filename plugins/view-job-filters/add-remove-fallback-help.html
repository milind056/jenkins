<div>This filter:
    <ul>
        <li>Adds all jobs to this view if no jobs are included by the previous filters.</li>
        <li>Removes all jobs from this view if all jobs are included by the previous filters.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h4><u>Rationale</u></h4>

<p>
    Useful if you have filters that might include all jobs or no jobs at all. In that case
    this filter can act as a fallback to ensures that this view either never will be empty
    or never will contain all jobs.
