<h4><u>Options</u></h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Match type:</dt>
    <dd>
        Whether to add or remove jobs from this view. There's two kinds of match types:<br>
        <ul style="margin-top:0px">
            <li>Include matched/unmatched: adds additional jobs to this view.</li>
            <li>Exclude matched/unmatched: removes jobs from this view that have been included by previous filters.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>


<h4><u>Note</u></h4>

<p>
    This filter does not <em>provide</em> security - it merely provides convenient views
    that feed off of the security you've already set up.
