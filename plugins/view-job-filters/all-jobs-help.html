    This filter simply adds all jobs to this view.

<h4><u>Rationale</u></h4>

<p>
    Using this filter is easier than selecting all checkboxes, and it's easier
    than specifying a regular expression like "<kbd>.*</kbd>". This is especially
    useful when you want an "All" view that has different columns than the
    defaults. It is also useful in combination with other filters which should
    be placed after this filter.
