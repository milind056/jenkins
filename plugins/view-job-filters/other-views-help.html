<div>
    This filter includes/excludes jobs based on the jobs in another view.
</div>

<h4><u>Rationale</u></h4>

<p>
    Useful, e.g., if you have a company-wide organizational hierarchy of projects, where different configuration managers might
    want to view a different sub-set of jobs, so there's no reason to manage each view's list of jobs if some views
    are simply meant to be an aggregate of other views.
</p>

<p>
    Another example is if you have one "special" view that contains utility or legacy jobs, and you want to easily
    exclude those jobs from other views, but there are no well-defined characteristics of those jobs that you can filter
    on. With this filter, you can put your effort into creating that special view, and then for other views simply
    choose to exclude all jobs that appear in that special view.
</p>

<h4><u>Options</u></h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Other View:</dt>
    <dd>This filter will match any job that's part of the view you select here.</dd>
    <dt>Match type:</dt>
    <dd>
        Whether to add or remove jobs from this view. There's two kinds of match types:<br>
        <ul style="margin-top:0px">
            <li>Include matched/unmatched: adds additional jobs to this view.</li>
            <li>Exclude matched/unmatched: removes jobs from this view that have been included by previous filters.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4><u>Note</u></h4>

<p>
    If you select a view as it's own "Other View" or otherwise create circular references between views
    this can lead to unpredictable behavior. This filter will warn you if that's the case.
