    <dt>SCM Type:</dt>
    <dd>
        Which type of job this filter should match. If the dropdown doesn't
        have the type of SCM you're looking for that means you don't have
        the necessary plugin installed.
    </dd>
    <dt>Match type:</dt>
    <dd>

        <ul style="margin-top:0px">
            <li>Include matched/unmatched: adds additional jobs to this view.</li>
            <li>Exclude matched/unmatched: removes jobs from this view that have been included by previous filters.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
