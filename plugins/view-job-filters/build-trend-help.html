<div>
    This filter includes/excludes jobs based on how their builds were started and how they finished.
</div>

<h4><u>Options</u></h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Build trend type:</dt>
    <dd>
        How a job's builds must have been started or how they must have finished in order for this filter to match.
    </dd>
    <dt>How far back to check:</dt>
    <dd>
        A job can have many builds and this option determines how many of those builds
        will be checked. Always goes backwards from the latest build. Can be a decimal
        number, e.g. <kbd>1.5</kbd> hours. If you want to include all builds set this
        value to <kbd>0</kbd>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Match type:</dt>
    <dd>
        Whether to add or remove jobs from this view. There's two kinds of match types:<br>
        <ul style="margin-top:0px">
            <li>Include matched/unmatched: adds additional jobs to this view.</li>
            <li>Exclude matched/unmatched: removes jobs from this view that have been included by previous filters.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>
